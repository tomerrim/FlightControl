# FlightControl
FlightControl is a C# project that simulates airplanes arriving and departing from an airport. The project features a server-side ASP .NET Core Web API, a client-side ASP .NET Core MVC application, and a MSSQL database. The project also includes SignalR for an open connection between the server and the client. Additionally, there is a console application that creates flights and sends them to the server. The server-side logic moves the flights between terminals, and every time a plane moves to a different terminal, it is written to the database. With its sophisticated features and attention to detail, FlightControl is an impressive simulation of real-world air traffic management.
